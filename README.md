Random Bash Scripts I use

- [Create Maven Project](https://github.com/pjhamilton4/bash-scripts-misc/blob/master/maven-quick-project.sh) - maven-quick-project.sh is a shell script used to create a maven project from the archetype "maven-archetype-quickstart" this is from the official maven project https://maven.apache.org/archetypes/maven-archetype-quickstart/.
- [Change Names](https://github.com/pjhamilton4/bash-scripts-misc/blob/master/change_names.sh) - change_names.sh is a shell script I was using to rename ebooks I had purchased through humble bundle offers.
